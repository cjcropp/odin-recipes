#In this project I created a website with a homepage that links to three different recipes. Each recipe page displays an image, an unordered list of ingredients, and an ordered list of step by step directions. This project helped me learn basic webpage construction. I encountered an issue with the images not displaying, but working through that problem taught me about using the correct pathways when implementing relative links.
